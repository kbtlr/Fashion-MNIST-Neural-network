This is a simple neural network designed to recognise articles of clothing to a reasonable degree of accuracy. The project was trained on the pre-existing Fashion-MNIST dataset.

The project is designed to be run with Google Colab, so a google account is required, with a filepath called "Colab Notebooks" in your drive root. Sign in to Colab, and open the "Fashion_MNIST_code" file.
If needed, grant any and all permisssions. After, the code will run as needed, with no further input. Final accuracy will be expressed as a decimal.

Open source, use as you like.
